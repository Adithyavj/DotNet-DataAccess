Data Access in C#

## Basic Normalisation:
Normalization is the process of reducing or eliminating
redundant data in your database which also improves
data integrity.

There are 5 levels of normalization:
- 1NF
- 2NF
- 3NF

Surrogate Key - Primary key (auto incremented and unique)
Normal Key - Natural key (unique by default (business logic))

One to One
One to Many relation
Many to Many

## ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
- Takes data from Database and converts it into c# objects.
- ADO.NET
	- Helps to take data from DB to Code. ## Then we have to do ORM and model the data.
- There are many ORM tools.
- Dapper is a tool provided by Stack Overflow. It is a Micro ORM.
- Dapper is almost as fast as ADO.NET and we don't have to do the mapping from DataTables to our objects.
- Entity Framework is another tool for ORM. Provided by Microsoft.

Different ways of data access in C# are:
- ADO.NET
- Dapper
- Entity Framework Core
